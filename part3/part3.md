1. the bug is that the program is supposed to add two integer value and output the sum of these two integer value. However, the problem is that the integer value is represented as a string value and it just added two string together. 
2. i would fix this by converting the num1 and num2 into an integer before adding them together. let result = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2); parseInt could convert an string into an integer.
